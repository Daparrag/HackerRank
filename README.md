Num | Name | Desciption | link
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | Multiples of 3 and 5 | If we list all the natural numbers below N that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.  Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 ir 5 below N. | [link](Project_Euler/PE1_Multi_3_and_5.cpp)
